A model that will help to classify the legal clauses extracted from Credit Agreements into itâ€™s legal clause type.

I have used Multi-Class classifier Artificial Neural Networks.

4. Currently model is trained considering the 5 Types given: 1. Preamble 2. Governing Law 3. Lender Deafulting 4. Indemnification 5. Other
5. To feed data for prediction, create a test.csv file in same 'Encipher' folder with 2 columns 'Id' and 'Agreement'.
